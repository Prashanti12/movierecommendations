# Movie Recommendation System

Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in
today’s hectic world. People are always in the lookout for
products/services that are best suited for them. Therefore, the
recommendation systems are important as they help them make the
right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.
Entertainment is very crucial in today’s world for almost everybody.
Everyone wants to watch a good movie without getting bored and
without wasting time and money. So this is when a recommendation
system comes to work.

In this project, we will understand the basics of Recommendation
Systems and learn how to build an ITEM based Movie Recommendation System
by implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. We will also
predict the rating of the given movie based on its neighbors and
compare it with the actual rating.
We are committed to developing a transparent and accessible
project, and we will share our progress and results with the wider
community. We believe that our project can make a contribution to
the field of movie recommendation and machine learning

# DATASETS

The dataset used in this context is downloaded from MovieLens
datasets and saved to the working directory.
To read the contents of the file into a Python program, used the
Pandas library's "read_csv()" function. It has information about
9000 unique movies. It has two csv files:
1. movies.csv : this file contain movieId,title of movies and genre of
movies.
2. rating.csv : this file contain ratings given by userId to MovieId and
rating given to movieId.

# Libraries Used
1.NumPy
2.Pandas
3.Mathplotlib
4.Streamlit

# Deploying the model:
Here streamlit is used to deploy the model.
